CHAPTER
XXXIII
Note
I
Hedge
Priests
It
is
curious
to
observe
that
in
every
state
of
society
some
sort
of
ghostly
consolation
is
provided
for
the
members
of
the
community
though
assembled
for
purposes
diametrically
opposite
to
religion
A
gang
of
beggars
have
their
Patrico
and
the
banditti
of
the
Apennines
have
among
them
persons
acting
as
monks
and
priests
by
whom
they
are
confessed
and
who
perform
mass
before
them
Unquestionably
such
reverend
persons
in
such
a
society
must
accommodate
their
manners
and
their
morals
to
the
community
in
which
they
live
and
if
they
can
occasionally
obtain
a
degree
of
reverence
for
their
supposed
spiritual
gifts
are
on
most
occasions
loaded
with
unmerciful
ridicule
as
possessing
a
character
inconsistent
with
all
around
them
Hence
the
fighting
parson
in
the
old
play
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
and
the
famous
friar
of
Robin
Hood
s
band
Nor
were
such
characters
ideal
There
exists
a
monition
of
the
Bishop
of
Durham
against
irregular
churchmen
of
this
class
who
associated
themselves
with
Border
robbers
and
desecrated
the
holiest
offices
of
the
priestly
function
by
celebrating
them
for
the
benefit
of
thieves
robbers
and
murderers
amongst
ruins
and
in
caverns
of
the
earth
without
regard
to
canonical
form
and
with
torn
and
dirty
attire
and
maimed
rites
altogether
improper
for
the
occasion
