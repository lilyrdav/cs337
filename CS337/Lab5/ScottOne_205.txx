CHAPTER
XXXII
Note
H
Richard
Cœur
de
Lion
The
interchange
of
a
cuff
with
the
jolly
priest
is
not
entirely
out
of
character
with
Richard
I
if
romances
read
him
aright
In
the
very
curious
romance
on
the
subject
of
his
adventures
in
the
Holy
Land
and
his
return
from
thence
it
is
recorded
how
he
exchanged
a
pugilistic
favour
of
this
nature
while
a
prisoner
in
Germany
His
opponent
was
the
son
of
his
principal
warder
and
was
so
imprudent
as
to
give
the
challenge
to
this
barter
of
buffets
The
King
stood
forth
like
a
true
man
and
received
a
blow
which
staggered
him
In
requital
having
previously
waxed
his
hand
a
practice
unknown
I
believe
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
modern
fancy
he
returned
the
box
on
the
ear
with
such
interest
as
to
kill
his
antagonist
on
the
spot
