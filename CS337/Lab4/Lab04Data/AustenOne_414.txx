CHAPTER
L
After
a
proper
resistance
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Ferrars
just
so
violent
and
so
steady
as
to
preserve
her
from
that
reproach
which
she
always
seemed
fearful
of
incurring
the
reproach
of
being
too
amiable
Edward
was
admitted
to
her
presence
and
pronounced
to
be
again
her
son
Her
family
had
of
late
been
exceedingly
fluctuating
For
many
years
of
her
life
she
had
had
two
sons
but
the
crime
and
annihilation
of
Edward
a
few
weeks
ago
had
robbed
her
of
one
the
similar
annihilation
of
Robert
had
left
her
for
a
fortnight
without
any
and
now
by
the
resuscitation
of
Edward
she
had
one
again
In
spite
of
his
being
allowed
once
more
to
live
however
he
did
not
feel
the
continuance
of
his
existence
secure
till
he
had
revealed
his
present
engagement
for
the
publication
of
that
circumstance
he
feared
might
give
a
sudden
turn
to
his
constitution
and
carry
him
off
as
rapidly
as
before
With
apprehensive
caution
therefore
it
was
revealed
and
he
was
listened
to
with
unexpected
calmness
Mrs
Ferrars
at
first
reasonably
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
marrying
Miss
Dashwood
by
every
argument
in
her
powertold
him
that
in
Miss
Morton
he
would
have
a
woman
of
higher
rank
and
larger
fortuneand
enforced
the
assertion
by
observing
that
Miss
Morton
was
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
with
thirty
thousand
pounds
while
Miss
Dashwood
was
only
the
daughter
of
a
private
gentleman
with
no
more
than
three
but
when
she
found
that
though
perfectly
admitting
the
truth
of
her
representation
he
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
be
guided
by
it
she
judged
it
wisest
from
the
experience
of
the
past
to
submitand
therefore
after
such
an
ungracious
delay
as
she
owed
to
her
own
dignity
and
as
served
to
prevent
every
suspicion
of
goodwill
she
issued
her
decree
of
consent
to
the
marriage
of
Edward
and
Elinor
What
she
would
engage
to
do
towards
augmenting
their
income
was
next
to
be
considered
and
here
it
plainly
appeared
that
though
Edward
was
now
her
only
son
he
was
by
no
means
her
eldest
for
while
Robert
was
inevitably
endowed
with
a
thousand
pounds
ayear
not
the
smallest
objection
was
made
against
Edwards
taking
orders
for
the
sake
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
utmost
nor
was
anything
promised
either
for
the
present
or
in
future
beyond
the
ten
thousand
pounds
which
had
been
given
with
Fanny
It
was
as
much
however
as
was
desired
and
more
than
was
expected
by
Edward
and
Elinor
and
Mrs
Ferrars
herself
by
her
shuffling
excuses
seemed
the
only
person
surprised
at
her
not
giving
more
With
an
income
quite
sufficient
to
their
wants
thus
secured
to
them
they
had
nothing
to
wait
for
after
Edward
was
in
possession
of
the
living
but
the
readiness
of
the
house
to
which
Colonel
Brandon
with
an
eager
desire
for
the
accommodation
of
Elinor
was
making
considerable
improvements
and
after
waiting
some
time
for
their
completion
after
experiencing
as
usual
a
thousand
disappointments
and
delays
from
the
unaccountable
dilatoriness
of
the
workmen
Elinor
as
usual
broke
through
the
first
positive
resolution
of
not
marrying
till
every
thing
was
ready
and
the
ceremony
took
place
in
Barton
church
early
in
the
autumn
The
first
month
after
their
marriage
was
spent
with
their
friend
at
the
Mansionhouse
from
whence
they
could
superintend
the
progress
of
the
Parsonage
and
direct
every
thing
as
they
liked
on
the
spotcould
chuse
papers
project
shrubberies
and
invent
a
sweep
Mrs
Jenningss
prophecies
though
rather
jumbled
together
were
chiefly
fulfilled
for
she
was
able
to
visit
Edward
and
his
wife
in
their
Parsonage
by
Michaelmas
and
she
found
in
Elinor
and
her
husband
as
she
really
believed
one
of
the
happiest
couples
in
the
world
They
had
in
fact
nothing
to
wish
for
but
the
marriage
of
Colonel
Brandon
and
Marianne
and
rather
better
pasturage
for
their
cows
They
were
visited
on
their
first
settling
by
almost
all
their
relations
and
friends
Mrs
Ferrars
came
to
inspect
the
happiness
which
she
was
almost
ashamed
of
having
authorised
and
even
the
Dashwoods
were
at
the
expense
of
a
journey
from
Sussex
to
do
them
honour
I
will
not
say
that
I
am
disappointed
my
dear
sister
said
John
as
they
were
walking
together
one
morning
before
the
gates
of
Delaford
House
that
would
be
saying
too
much
for
certainly
you
have
been
one
of
the
most
fortunate
young
women
in
the
world
as
it
is
But
I
confess
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
call
Colonel
Brandon
brother
His
property
here
his
place
his
house
every
thing
is
in
such
respectable
and
excellent
condition
And
his
woodsI
have
not
seen
such
timber
any
where
in
Dorsetshire
as
there
is
now
standing
in
Delaford
Hanger
And
though
perhaps
Marianne
may
not
seem
exactly
the
person
to
attract
him
yet
I
think
it
would
altogether
be
advisable
for
you
to
have
them
now
frequently
staying
with
you
for
as
Colonel
Brandon
seems
a
great
deal
at
home
nobody
can
tell
what
may
happen
for
when
people
are
much
thrown
together
and
see
little
of
anybody
elseand
it
will
always
be
in
your
power
to
set
her
off
to
advantage
and
so
forth
In
short
you
may
as
well
give
her
a
chance
you
understand
me
But
though
Mrs
Ferrars
did
come
to
see
them
and
always
treated
them
with
the
makebelieve
of
decent
affection
they
were
never
insulted
by
her
real
favour
and
preference
That
was
due
to
the
folly
of
Robert
and
the
cunning
of
his
wife
and
it
was
earned
by
them
before
many
months
had
passed
away
The
selfish
sagacity
of
the
latter
which
had
at
first
drawn
Robert
into
the
scrape
was
the
principal
instrument
of
his
deliverance
from
it
for
her
respectful
humility
assiduous
attentions
and
endless
flatteries
as
soon
as
the
smallest
opening
was
given
for
their
exercise
reconciled
Mrs
Ferrars
to
his
choice
and
reestablished
him
completely
in
her
favour
The
whole
of
Lucys
behaviour
in
the
affair
and
the
prosperity
which
crowned
it
therefore
may
be
held
forth
as
a
most
encouraging
instance
of
what
an
earnest
an
unceasing
attention
to
selfinterest
however
its
progress
may
be
apparently
obstructed
will
do
in
securing
every
advantage
of
fortune
with
no
other
sacrifice
than
that
of
time
and
conscience
When
Robert
first
sought
her
acquaintance
and
privately
visited
her
in
Bartletts
Buildings
it
was
only
with
the
view
imputed
to
him
by
his
brother
He
merely
meant
to
persuade
her
to
give
up
the
engagement
and
as
there
could
be
nothing
to
overcome
but
the
affection
of
both
he
naturally
expected
that
one
or
two
interviews
would
settle
the
matter
In
that
point
however
and
that
only
he
erred
for
though
Lucy
soon
gave
him
hopes
that
his
eloquence
would
convince
her
in
time
another
visit
another
conversation
was
always
wanted
to
produce
this
conviction
Some
doubts
always
lingered
in
her
mind
when
they
parted
which
could
only
be
removed
by
another
half
hours
discourse
with
himself
His
attendance
was
by
this
means
secured
and
the
rest
followed
in
course
Instead
of
talking
of
Edward
they
came
gradually
to
talk
only
of
Roberta
subject
on
which
he
had
always
more
to
say
than
on
any
other
and
in
which
she
soon
betrayed
an
interest
even
equal
to
his
own
and
in
short
it
became
speedily
evident
to
both
that
he
had
entirely
supplanted
his
brother
He
was
proud
of
his
conquest
proud
of
tricking
Edward
and
very
proud
of
marrying
privately
without
his
mothers
consent
What
immediately
followed
is
known
They
passed
some
months
in
great
happiness
at
Dawlish
for
she
had
many
relations
and
old
acquaintances
to
cutand
he
drew
several
plans
for
magnificent
cottagesand
from
thence
returning
to
town
procured
the
forgiveness
of
Mrs
Ferrars
by
the
simple
expedient
of
asking
it
which
at
Lucys
instigation
was
adopted
The
forgiveness
at
first
indeed
as
was
reasonable
comprehended
only
Robert
and
Lucy
who
had
owed
his
mother
no
duty
and
therefore
could
have
transgressed
none
still
remained
some
weeks
longer
unpardoned
But
perseverance
in
humility
of
conduct
and
messages
in
selfcondemnation
for
Roberts
offence
and
gratitude
for
the
unkindness
she
was
treated
with
procured
her
in
time
the
haughty
notice
which
overcame
her
by
its
graciousness
and
led
soon
afterwards
by
rapid
degrees
to
the
highest
state
of
affection
and
influence
Lucy
became
as
necessary
to
Mrs
Ferrars
as
either
Robert
or
Fanny
and
while
Edward
was
never
cordially
forgiven
for
having
once
intended
to
marry
her
and
Elinor
though
superior
to
her
in
fortune
and
birth
was
spoken
of
as
an
intruder
she
was
in
every
thing
considered
and
always
openly
acknowledged
to
be
a
favourite
child
They
settled
in
town
received
very
liberal
assistance
from
Mrs
Ferrars
were
on
the
best
terms
imaginable
with
the
Dashwoods
and
setting
aside
the
jealousies
and
illwill
continually
subsisting
between
Fanny
and
Lucy
in
which
their
husbands
of
course
took
a
part
as
well
as
the
frequent
domestic
disagreements
between
Robert
and
Lucy
themselves
nothing
could
exceed
the
harmony
in
which
they
all
lived
together
What
Edward
had
done
to
forfeit
the
right
of
eldest
son
might
have
puzzled
many
people
to
find
out
and
what
Robert
had
done
to
succeed
to
it
might
have
puzzled
them
still
more
It
was
an
arrangement
however
justified
in
its
effects
if
not
in
its
cause
for
nothing
ever
appeared
in
Roberts
style
of
living
or
of
talking
to
give
a
suspicion
of
his
regretting
the
extent
of
his
income
as
either
leaving
his
brother
too
little
or
bringing
himself
too
muchand
if
Edward
might
be
judged
from
the
ready
discharge
of
his
duties
in
every
particular
from
an
increasing
attachment
to
his
wife
and
his
home
and
from
the
regular
cheerfulness
of
his
spirits
he
might
be
supposed
no
less
contented
with
his
lot
no
less
free
from
every
wish
of
an
exchange
Elinors
marriage
divided
her
as
little
from
her
family
as
could
well
be
contrived
without
rendering
the
cottage
at
Barton
entirely
useless
for
her
mother
and
sisters
spent
much
more
than
half
their
time
with
her
Mrs
Dashwood
was
acting
on
motives
of
policy
as
well
as
pleasure
in
the
frequency
of
her
visits
at
Delaford
for
her
wish
of
bringing
Marianne
and
Colonel
Brandon
together
was
hardly
less
earnest
though
rather
more
liberal
than
what
John
had
expressed
It
was
now
her
darling
object
Precious
as
was
the
company
of
her
daughter
to
her
she
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
give
up
its
constant
enjoyment
to
her
valued
friend
and
to
see
Marianne
settled
at
the
mansionhouse
was
equally
the
wish
of
Edward
and
Elinor
They
each
felt
his
sorrows
and
their
own
obligations
and
Marianne
by
general
consent
was
to
be
the
reward
of
all
With
such
a
confederacy
against
herwith
a
knowledge
so
intimate
of
his
goodnesswith
a
conviction
of
his
fond
attachment
to
herself
which
at
last
though
long
after
it
was
observable
to
everybody
elseburst
on
herwhat
could
she
do
Marianne
Dashwood
was
born
to
an
extraordinary
fate
She
was
born
to
discover
the
falsehood
of
her
own
opinions
and
to
counteract
by
her
conduct
her
most
favourite
maxims
She
was
born
to
overcome
an
affection
formed
so
late
in
life
as
at
seventeen
and
with
no
sentiment
superior
to
strong
esteem
and
lively
friendship
voluntarily
to
give
her
hand
to
anotherand
that
other
a
man
who
had
suffered
no
less
than
herself
under
the
event
of
a
former
attachment
whom
two
years
before
she
had
considered
too
old
to
be
marriedand
who
still
sought
the
constitutional
safeguard
of
a
flannel
waistcoat
But
so
it
was
Instead
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
an
irresistible
passion
as
once
she
had
fondly
flattered
herself
with
expectinginstead
of
remaining
even
for
ever
with
her
mother
and
finding
her
only
pleasures
in
retirement
and
study
as
afterwards
in
her
more
calm
and
sober
judgment
she
had
determined
onshe
found
herself
at
nineteen
submitting
to
new
attachments
entering
on
new
duties
placed
in
a
new
home
a
wife
the
mistress
of
a
family
and
the
patroness
of
a
village
Colonel
Brandon
was
now
as
happy
as
all
those
who
best
loved
him
believed
he
deserved
to
bein
Marianne
he
was
consoled
for
every
past
afflictionher
regard
and
her
society
restored
his
mind
to
animation
and
his
spirits
to
cheerfulness
and
that
Marianne
found
her
own
happiness
in
forming
his
was
equally
the
persuasion
and
delight
of
each
observing
friend
Marianne
could
never
love
by
halves
and
her
whole
heart
became
in
time
as
much
devoted
to
her
husband
as
it
had
once
been
to
Willoughby
Willoughby
could
not
hear
of
her
marriage
without
a
pang
and
his
punishment
was
soon
afterwards
complete
in
the
voluntary
forgiveness
of
Mrs
Smith
who
by
stating
his
marriage
with
a
woman
of
character
as
the
source
of
her
clemency
gave
him
reason
for
believing
that
had
he
behaved
with
honour
towards
Marianne
he
might
at
once
have
been
happy
and
rich
That
his
repentance
of
misconduct
which
thus
brought
its
own
punishment
was
sincere
need
not
be
doubtednor
that
he
long
thought
of
Colonel
Brandon
with
envy
and
of
Marianne
with
regret
But
that
he
was
for
ever
inconsolable
that
he
fled
from
society
or
contracted
an
habitual
gloom
of
temper
or
died
of
a
broken
heart
must
not
be
depended
onfor
he
did
neither
He
lived
to
exert
and
frequently
to
enjoy
himself
His
wife
was
not
always
out
of
humour
nor
his
home
always
uncomfortable
and
in
his
breed
of
horses
and
dogs
and
in
sporting
of
every
kind
he
found
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
domestic
felicity
For
Marianne
however
in
spite
of
his
incivility
in
surviving
her
loss
he
always
retained
that
decided
regard
which
interested
him
in
every
thing
that
befell
her
and
made
her
his
secret
standard
of
perfection
in
woman
and
many
a
rising
beauty
would
be
slighted
by
him
in
afterdays
as
bearing
no
comparison
with
Mrs
Brandon
Mrs
Dashwood
was
prudent
enough
to
remain
at
the
cottage
without
attempting
a
removal
to
Delaford
and
fortunately
for
Sir
John
and
Mrs
Jennings
when
Marianne
was
taken
from
them
Margaret
had
reached
an
age
highly
suitable
for
dancing
and
not
very
ineligible
for
being
supposed
to
have
a
lover
Between
Barton
and
Delaford
there
was
that
constant
communication
which
strong
family
affection
would
naturally
dictate
and
among
the
merits
and
the
happiness
of
Elinor
and
Marianne
let
it
not
be
ranked
as
the
least
considerable
that
though
sisters
and
living
almost
within
sight
of
each
other
they
could
live
without
disagreement
between
themselves
or
producing
coolness
between
their
husbands

Hart
was
the
originator
of
the
Project
Gutenbergtm
concept
of
a
library
of
electronic
works
that
could
be
freely
shared
with
anyone
For
forty
years
he
produced
and
distributed
Project
Gutenbergtm
eBooks
with
only
a
loose
network
of
volunteer
support
Project
Gutenbergtm
eBooks
are
often
created
from
several
printed
editions
all
of
which
are
confirmed
as
not
protected
by
copyright
in
the
US
unless
a
copyright
notice
is
included
Thus
we
do
not
necessarily
keep
eBooks
in
compliance
with
any
particular
paper
edition
Most
people
start
at
our
Web
site
which
has
the
main
PG
search
facility
wwwgutenbergorg
This
Web
site
includes
information
about
Project
Gutenbergtm
including
how
to
make
donations
to
the
Project
Gutenberg
Literary
Archive
Foundation
how
to
help
produce
our
new
eBooks
