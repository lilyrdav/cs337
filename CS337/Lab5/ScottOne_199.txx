CHAPTER
II
Note
B
Negro
Slaves
The
severe
accuracy
of
some
critics
has
objected
to
the
complexion
of
the
slaves
of
Brian
de
Bois
Guilbert
as
being
totally
out
of
costume
and
propriety
I
remember
the
same
objection
being
made
to
a
set
of
sable
functionaries
whom
my
friend
Mat
Lewis
introduced
as
the
guards
and
mischief
doing
satellites
of
the
wicked
Baron
in
his
Castle
Spectre
Mat
treated
the
objection
with
great
contempt
and
averred
in
reply
that
he
made
the
slaves
black
in
order
to
obtain
a
striking
effect
of
contrast
and
that
could
he
have
derived
a
similar
advantage
from
making
his
heroine
blue
blue
she
should
have
been
I
do
not
pretend
to
plead
the
immunities
of
my
order
so
highly
as
this
but
neither
will
I
allow
that
the
author
of
a
modern
antique
romance
is
obliged
to
confine
himself
to
the
introduction
of
those
manners
only
which
can
be
proved
to
have
absolutely
existed
in
the
times
he
is
depicting
so
that
he
restrain
himself
to
such
as
are
plausible
and
natural
and
contain
no
obvious
anachronism
In
this
point
of
view
what
can
be
more
natural
than
that
the
Templars
who
we
know
copied
closely
the
luxuries
of
the
Asiatic
warriors
with
whom
they
fought
should
use
the
service
of
the
enslaved
Africans
whom
the
fate
of
war
transferred
to
new
masters
I
am
sure
if
there
are
no
precise
proofs
of
their
having
done
so
there
is
nothing
on
the
other
hand
that
can
entitle
us
positively
to
conclude
that
they
never
did
Besides
there
is
an
instance
in
romance
John
of
Rampayne
an
excellent
juggler
and
minstrel
undertook
to
effect
the
escape
of
one
Audulf
de
Bracy
by
presenting
himself
in
disguise
at
the
court
of
the
king
where
he
was
confined
For
this
purpose
he
stained
his
hair
and
his
whole
body
entirely
as
black
as
jet
so
that
nothing
was
white
but
his
teeth
and
succeeded
in
imposing
himself
on
the
king
as
an
Ethiopian
minstrel
He
effected
by
stratagem
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
Negroes
therefore
must
have
been
known
in
England
in
the
dark
ages
