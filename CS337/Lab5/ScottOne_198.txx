CHAPTER
I
Note
A
The
Ranger
or
the
Forest
that
cuts
the
foreclaws
off
our
dogs
A
most
sensible
grievance
of
those
aggrieved
times
were
the
Forest
Laws
These
oppressive
enactments
were
the
produce
of
the
Norman
Conquest
for
the
Saxon
laws
of
the
chase
were
mild
and
humane
while
those
of
William
enthusiastically
attached
to
the
exercise
and
its
rights
were
to
the
last
degree
tyrannical
The
formation
of
the
New
Forest
bears
evidence
to
his
passion
for
hunting
where
he
reduced
many
a
happy
village
to
the
condition
of
that
one
commemorated
by
my
friend
Mr
William
Stewart
Rose
Amongst
the
ruins
of
the
church
The
midnight
raven
found
a
perch
A
melancholy
place
The
ruthless
Conqueror
cast
down
Woe
worth
the
deed
that
little
town
To
lengthen
out
his
chase
The
disabling
dogs
which
might
be
necessary
for
keeping
flocks
and
herds
from
running
at
the
deer
was
called
lawing
and
was
in
general
use
The
Charter
of
the
Forest
designed
to
lessen
those
evils
declares
that
inquisition
or
view
for
lawing
dogs
shall
be
made
every
third
year
and
shall
be
then
done
by
the
view
and
testimony
of
lawful
men
not
otherwise
and
they
whose
dogs
shall
be
then
found
unlawed
shall
give
three
shillings
for
mercy
and
for
the
future
no
man
s
ox
shall
be
taken
for
lawing
Such
lawing
also
shall
be
done
by
the
assize
commonly
used
and
which
is
that
three
claws
shall
be
cut
off
without
the
ball
of
the
right
foot
