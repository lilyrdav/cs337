CHAPTER
TWENTY
SECOND
But
now
the
hand
of
fate
is
on
the
curtain
And
gives
the
scene
to
light
Don
Sebastian
I
felt
stunned
and
chilled
as
they
retired
Imagination
dwelling
on
an
absent
object
of
affection
paints
her
not
only
in
the
fairest
light
but
in
that
in
which
we
most
desire
to
behold
her
I
had
thought
of
Diana
as
she
was
when
her
parting
tear
dropped
on
my
cheek
when
her
parting
token
received
from
the
wife
of
MacGregor
augured
her
wish
to
convey
into
exile
and
conventual
seclusion
the
remembrance
of
my
affection
I
saw
her
and
her
cold
passive
manner
expressive
of
little
except
composed
melancholy
disappointed
and
in
some
degree
almost
offended
me
In
the
egotism
of
my
feelings
I
accused
her
of
indifference
of
insensibility
I
upbraided
her
father
with
pride
with
cruelty
with
fanaticism
forgetting
that
both
were
sacrificing
their
interest
and
Diana
her
inclination
to
the
discharge
of
what
they
regarded
as
their
duty
Sir
Frederick
Vernon
was
a
rigid
Catholic
who
thought
the
path
of
salvation
too
narrow
to
be
trodden
by
an
heretic
and
Diana
to
whom
her
father
s
safety
had
been
for
many
years
the
principal
and
moving
spring
of
thoughts
hopes
and
actions
felt
that
she
had
discharged
her
duty
in
resigning
to
his
will
not
alone
her
property
in
the
world
but
the
dearest
affections
of
her
heart
But
it
was
not
surprising
that
I
could
not
at
such
a
moment
fully
appreciate
these
honourable
motives
yet
my
spleen
sought
no
ignoble
means
of
discharging
itself
I
am
contemned
then
I
said
when
left
to
run
over
the
tenor
of
Sir
Frederick
s
communications
I
am
contemned
and
thought
unworthy
even
to
exchange
words
with
her
Be
it
so
they
shall
not
at
least
prevent
me
from
watching
over
her
safety
Here
will
I
remain
as
an
outpost
and
while
under
my
roof
at
least
no
danger
shall
threaten
her
if
it
be
such
as
the
arm
of
one
determined
man
can
avert
I
summoned
Syddall
to
the
library
He
came
but
came
attended
by
the
eternal
Andrew
who
dreaming
of
great
things
in
consequence
of
my
taking
possession
of
the
Hall
and
the
annexed
estates
was
resolved
to
lose
nothing
for
want
of
keeping
himself
in
view
and
as
often
happens
to
men
who
entertain
selfish
objects
overshot
his
mark
and
rendered
his
attentions
tedious
and
inconvenient
His
unrequired
presence
prevented
me
from
speaking
freely
to
Syddall
and
I
dared
not
send
him
away
for
fear
of
increasing
such
suspicions
as
he
might
entertain
from
his
former
abrupt
dismissal
from
the
library
I
shall
sleep
here
sir
I
said
giving
them
directions
to
wheel
nearer
to
the
fire
an
old
fashioned
day
bed
or
settee
I
have
much
to
do
and
shall
go
late
to
bed
Syddall
who
seemed
to
understand
my
look
offered
to
procure
me
the
accommodation
of
a
mattress
and
some
bedding
I
accepted
his
offer
dismissed
my
attendant
lighted
a
pair
of
candles
and
desired
that
I
might
not
be
disturbed
till
seven
in
the
ensuing
morning
The
domestics
retired
leaving
me
to
my
painful
and
ill
arranged
reflections
until
nature
worn
out
should
require
some
repose
I
endeavoured
forcibly
to
abstract
my
mind
from
the
singular
circumstances
in
which
I
found
myself
placed
Feelings
which
I
had
gallantly
combated
while
the
exciting
object
was
remote
were
now
exasperated
by
my
immediate
neighbourhood
to
her
whom
I
was
so
soon
to
part
with
for
ever
Her
name
was
written
in
every
book
which
I
attempted
to
peruse
and
her
image
forced
itself
on
me
in
whatever
train
of
thought
I
strove
to
engage
myself
It
was
like
the
officious
slave
of
Prior
s
Solomon
Abra
was
ready
ere
I
named
her
name
And
when
I
called
another
Abra
came
I
alternately
gave
way
to
these
thoughts
and
struggled
against
them
sometimes
yielding
to
a
mood
of
melting
tenderness
of
sorrow
which
was
scarce
natural
to
me
sometimes
arming
myself
with
the
hurt
pride
of
one
who
had
experienced
what
he
esteemed
unmerited
rejection
I
paced
the
library
until
I
had
chafed
myself
into
a
temporary
fever
I
then
threw
myself
on
the
couch
and
endeavoured
to
dispose
myself
to
sleep
but
it
was
in
vain
that
I
used
every
effort
to
compose
myself
that
I
lay
without
movement
of
finger
or
of
muscle
as
still
as
if
I
had
been
already
a
corpse
that
I
endeavoured
to
divert
or
banish
disquieting
thoughts
by
fixing
my
mind
on
some
act
of
repetition
or
arithmetical
process
My
blood
throbbed
to
my
feverish
apprehension
in
pulsations
which
resembled
the
deep
and
regular
strokes
of
a
distant
fulling
mill
and
tingled
in
my
veins
like
streams
of
liquid
fire
At
length
I
arose
opened
the
window
and
stood
by
it
for
some
time
in
the
clear
moonlight
receiving
in
part
at
least
that
refreshment
and
dissipation
of
ideas
from
the
clear
and
calm
scene
without
which
they
had
become
beyond
the
command
of
my
own
volition
I
resumed
my
place
on
the
couch
with
a
heart
Heaven
knows
not
lighter
but
firmer
and
more
resolved
for
endurance
In
a
short
time
a
slumber
crept
over
my
senses
still
however
though
my
senses
slumbered
my
soul
was
awake
to
the
painful
feelings
of
my
situation
and
my
dreams
were
of
mental
anguish
and
external
objects
of
terror
I
remember
a
strange
agony
under
which
I
conceived
myself
and
Diana
in
the
power
of
MacGregor
s
wife
and
about
to
be
precipitated
from
a
rock
into
the
lake
the
signal
was
to
be
the
discharge
of
a
cannon
fired
by
Sir
Frederick
Vernon
who
in
the
dress
of
a
Cardinal
officiated
at
the
ceremony
Nothing
could
be
more
lively
than
the
impression
which
I
received
of
this
imaginary
scene
I
could
paint
even
at
this
moment
the
mute
and
courageous
submission
expressed
in
Diana
s
features
the
wild
and
distorted
faces
of
the
executioners
who
crowded
around
us
with
mopping
and
mowing
grimaces
ever
changing
and
each
more
hideous
than
that
which
preceded
I
saw
the
rigid
and
inflexible
fanaticism
painted
in
the
face
of
the
father
I
saw
him
lift
the
fatal
match
the
deadly
signal
exploded
It
was
repeated
again
and
again
and
again
in
rival
thunders
by
the
echoes
of
the
surrounding
cliffs
and
I
awoke
from
fancied
horror
to
real
apprehension
The
sounds
in
my
dream
were
not
ideal
They
reverberated
on
my
waking
ears
but
it
was
two
or
three
minutes
ere
I
could
collect
myself
so
as
distinctly
to
understand
that
they
proceeded
from
a
violent
knocking
at
the
gate
I
leaped
from
my
couch
in
great
apprehension
took
my
sword
under
my
arm
and
hastened
to
forbid
the
admission
of
any
one
But
my
route
was
necessarily
circuitous
because
the
library
looked
not
upon
the
quadrangle
but
into
the
gardens
When
I
had
reached
a
staircase
the
windows
of
which
opened
upon
the
entrance
court
I
heard
the
feeble
and
intimidated
tones
of
Syddall
expostulating
with
rough
voices
which
demanded
admittance
by
the
warrant
of
Justice
Standish
and
in
the
King
s
name
and
threatened
the
old
domestic
with
the
heaviest
penal
consequences
if
he
refused
instant
obedience
Ere
they
had
ceased
I
heard
to
my
unspeakable
provocation
the
voice
of
Andrew
bidding
Syddall
stand
aside
and
let
him
open
the
door
If
they
come
in
King
George
s
name
we
have
naething
to
fear
we
hae
spent
baith
bluid
and
gowd
for
him
We
dinna
need
to
darn
ourselves
like
some
folks
Mr
Syddall
we
are
neither
Papists
nor
Jacobites
I
trow
It
was
in
vain
I
accelerated
my
pace
down
stairs
I
heard
bolt
after
bolt
withdrawn
by
the
officious
scoundrel
while
all
the
time
he
was
boasting
his
own
and
his
master
s
loyalty
to
King
George
and
I
could
easily
calculate
that
the
party
must
enter
before
I
could
arrive
at
the
door
to
replace
the
bars
Devoting
the
back
of
Andrew
Fairservice
to
the
cudgel
so
soon
as
I
should
have
time
to
pay
him
his
deserts
I
ran
back
to
the
library
barricaded
the
door
as
I
best
could
and
hastened
to
that
by
which
Diana
and
her
father
entered
and
begged
for
instant
admittance
Diana
herself
undid
the
door
She
was
ready
dressed
and
betrayed
neither
perturbation
nor
fear
Danger
is
so
familiar
to
us
she
said
that
we
are
always
prepared
to
meet
it
My
father
is
already
up
he
is
in
Rashleigh
s
apartment
We
will
escape
into
the
garden
and
thence
by
the
postern
gate
I
have
the
key
from
Syddall
in
case
of
need
into
the
wood
I
know
its
dingles
better
than
any
one
now
alive
Keep
them
a
few
minutes
in
play
And
dear
dear
Frank
once
more
fare
thee
well
She
vanished
like
a
meteor
to
join
her
father
and
the
intruders
were
rapping
violently
and
attempting
to
force
the
library
door
by
the
time
I
had
returned
into
it
You
robber
dogs
I
exclaimed
wilfully
mistaking
the
purpose
of
their
disturbance
if
you
do
not
instantly
quit
the
house
I
will
fire
my
blunderbuss
through
the
door
Fire
a
fule
s
bauble
said
Andrew
Fairservice
it
s
Mr
Clerk
Jobson
with
a
legal
warrant
To
search
for
take
and
apprehend
said
the
voice
of
that
execrable
pettifogger
the
bodies
of
certain
persons
in
my
warrant
named
charged
of
high
treason
under
the
13th
of
King
William
chapter
third
And
the
violence
on
the
door
was
renewed
I
am
rising
gentlemen
said
I
desirous
to
gain
as
much
time
as
possible
commit
no
violence
give
me
leave
to
look
at
your
warrant
and
if
it
is
formal
and
legal
I
shall
not
oppose
it
God
save
great
George
our
King
ejaculated
Andrew
I
tauld
ye
that
ye
would
find
nae
Jacobites
here
Spinning
out
the
time
as
much
as
possible
I
was
at
length
compelled
to
open
the
door
which
they
would
otherwise
have
forced
Mr
Jobson
entered
with
several
assistants
among
whom
I
discovered
the
younger
Wingfield
to
whom
doubtless
he
was
obliged
for
his
information
and
exhibited
his
warrant
directed
not
only
against
Frederick
Vernon
an
attainted
traitor
but
also
against
Diana
Vernon
spinster
and
Francis
Osbaldistone
gentleman
accused
of
misprision
of
treason
It
was
a
case
in
which
resistance
would
have
been
madness
I
therefore
after
capitulating
for
a
few
minutes
delay
surrendered
myself
a
prisoner
I
had
next
the
mortification
to
see
Jobson
go
straight
to
the
chamber
of
Miss
Vernon
and
I
learned
that
from
thence
without
hesitation
or
difficulty
he
went
to
the
room
where
Sir
Frederick
had
slept
The
hare
has
stolen
away
said
the
brute
but
her
form
is
warm
the
greyhounds
will
have
her
by
the
haunches
yet
A
scream
from
the
garden
announced
that
he
prophesied
too
truly
In
the
course
of
five
minutes
Rashleigh
entered
the
library
with
Sir
Frederick
Vernon
and
his
daughter
as
prisoners
The
fox
he
said
knew
his
old
earth
but
he
forgot
it
could
be
stopped
by
a
careful
huntsman
I
had
not
forgot
the
garden
gate
Sir
Frederick
or
if
that
title
suits
you
better
most
noble
Lord
Beauchamp
Rashleigh
said
Sir
Frederick
thou
art
a
detestable
villain
I
better
deserved
the
name
Sir
Knight
or
my
Lord
when
under
the
direction
of
an
able
tutor
I
sought
to
introduce
civil
war
into
the
bosom
of
a
peaceful
country
But
I
have
done
my
best
said
he
looking
upwards
to
atone
for
my
errors
I
could
hold
no
longer
I
had
designed
to
watch
their
proceedings
in
silence
but
I
felt
that
I
must
speak
or
die
If
hell
I
said
has
one
complexion
more
hideous
than
another
it
is
where
villany
is
masked
by
hypocrisy
Ha
my
gentle
cousin
said
Rashleigh
holding
a
candle
towards
me
and
surveying
me
from
head
to
foot
right
welcome
to
Osbaldistone
Hall
I
can
forgive
your
spleen
It
is
hard
to
lose
an
estate
and
a
mistress
in
one
night
for
we
shall
take
possession
of
this
poor
manor
house
in
the
name
of
the
lawful
heir
Sir
Rashleigh
Osbaldistone
While
Rashleigh
braved
it
out
in
this
manner
I
could
see
that
he
put
a
strong
force
upon
his
feelings
both
of
anger
and
shame
But
his
state
of
mind
was
more
obvious
when
Diana
Vernon
addressed
him
Rashleigh
she
said
I
pity
you
for
deep
as
the
evil
is
which
you
have
laboured
to
do
me
and
the
evil
you
have
actually
done
I
cannot
hate
you
so
much
as
I
scorn
and
pity
you
What
you
have
now
done
may
be
the
work
of
an
hour
but
will
furnish
you
with
reflection
for
your
life
of
what
nature
I
leave
to
your
own
conscience
which
will
not
slumber
for
ever
Rashleigh
strode
once
or
twice
through
the
room
came
up
to
the
side
table
on
which
wine
was
still
standing
and
poured
out
a
large
glass
with
a
trembling
hand
but
when
he
saw
that
we
observed
his
tremor
he
suppressed
it
by
a
strong
effort
and
looking
at
us
with
fixed
and
daring
composure
carried
the
bumper
to
his
head
without
spilling
a
drop
It
is
my
father
s
old
burgundy
he
said
looking
to
Jobson
I
am
glad
there
is
some
of
it
left
You
will
get
proper
persons
to
take
care
of
old
butler
and
that
foolish
Scotch
rascal
Meanwhile
we
will
convey
these
persons
to
a
more
proper
place
of
custody
I
have
provided
the
old
family
coach
for
your
convenience
he
said
though
I
am
not
ignorant
that
even
the
lady
could
brave
the
night
air
on
foot
or
on
horseback
were
the
errand
more
to
her
mind
Andrew
wrung
his
hands
I
only
said
that
my
master
was
surely
speaking
to
a
ghaist
in
the
library
and
the
villain
Lancie
to
betray
an
auld
friend
that
sang
aff
the
same
Psalm
book
wi
him
every
Sabbath
for
twenty
years
He
was
turned
out
of
the
house
together
with
Syddall
without
being
allowed
to
conclude
his
lamentation
His
expulsion
however
led
to
some
singular
consequences
Resolving
according
to
his
own
story
to
go
down
for
the
night
where
Mother
Simpson
would
give
him
a
lodging
for
old
acquaintance
sake
he
had
just
got
clear
of
the
avenue
and
into
the
old
wood
as
it
was
called
though
it
was
now
used
as
a
pasture
ground
rather
than
woodland
when
he
suddenly
lighted
on
a
drove
of
Scotch
cattle
which
were
lying
there
to
repose
themselves
after
the
day
s
journey
At
this
Andrew
was
in
no
way
surprised
it
being
the
well
known
custom
of
his
countrymen
who
take
care
of
those
droves
to
quarter
themselves
after
night
upon
the
best
unenclosed
grass
ground
they
can
find
and
depart
before
day
break
to
escape
paying
for
their
night
s
lodgings
But
he
was
both
surprised
and
startled
when
a
Highlander
springing
up
accused
him
of
disturbing
the
cattle
and
refused
him
to
pass
forward
till
he
had
spoken
to
his
master
The
mountaineer
conducted
Andrew
into
a
thicket
where
he
found
three
or
four
more
of
his
countrymen
And
said
Andrew
I
saw
sune
they
were
ower
mony
men
for
the
drove
and
from
the
questions
they
put
to
me
I
judged
they
had
other
tow
on
their
rock
They
questioned
him
closely
about
all
that
had
passed
at
Osbaldistone
Hall
and
seemed
surprised
and
concerned
at
the
report
he
made
to
them
And
troth
said
Andrew
I
tauld
them
a
I
ken
d
for
dirks
and
pistols
were
what
I
could
never
refuse
information
to
in
a
my
life
They
talked
in
whispers
among
themselves
and
at
length
collected
their
cattle
together
and
drove
them
close
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
avenue
which
might
be
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
house
They
proceeded
to
drag
together
some
felled
trees
which
lay
in
the
vicinity
so
as
to
make
a
temporary
barricade
across
the
road
about
fifteen
yards
beyond
the
avenue
It
was
now
near
daybreak
and
there
was
a
pale
eastern
gleam
mingled
with
the
fading
moonlight
so
that
objects
could
be
discovered
with
some
distinctness
The
lumbering
sound
of
a
coach
drawn
by
four
horses
and
escorted
by
six
men
on
horseback
was
heard
coming
up
the
avenue
The
Highlanders
listened
attentively
The
carriage
contained
Mr
Jobson
and
his
unfortunate
prisoners
The
escort
consisted
of
Rashleigh
and
of
several
horsemen
peace
officers
and
their
assistants
So
soon
as
we
had
passed
the
gate
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
it
was
shut
behind
the
cavalcade
by
a
Highland
man
stationed
there
for
that
purpose
At
the
same
time
the
carriage
was
impeded
in
its
farther
progress
by
the
cattle
amongst
which
we
were
involved
and
by
the
barricade
in
front
Two
of
the
escort
dismounted
to
remove
the
felled
trees
which
they
might
think
were
left
there
by
accident
or
carelessness
The
others
began
with
their
whips
to
drive
the
cattle
from
the
road
Who
dare
abuse
our
cattle
said
a
rough
voice
Shoot
him
Angus
Rashleigh
instantly
called
out
A
rescue
a
rescue
and
firing
a
pistol
wounded
the
man
who
spoke
Claymore
cried
the
leader
of
the
Highlanders
and
a
scuffle
instantly
commenced
The
officers
of
the
law
surprised
at
so
sudden
an
attack
and
not
usually
possessing
the
most
desperate
bravery
made
but
an
imperfect
defence
considering
the
superiority
of
their
numbers
Some
attempted
to
ride
back
to
the
Hall
but
on
a
pistol
being
fired
from
behind
the
gate
they
conceived
themselves
surrounded
and
at
length
galloped
of
in
different
directions
Rashleigh
meanwhile
had
dismounted
and
on
foot
had
maintained
a
desperate
and
single
handed
conflict
with
the
leader
of
the
band
The
window
of
the
carriage
on
my
side
permitted
me
to
witness
it
At
length
Rashleigh
dropped
Will
you
ask
forgiveness
for
the
sake
of
God
King
James
and
auld
friendship
said
a
voice
which
I
knew
right
well
No
never
said
Rashleigh
firmly
Then
traitor
die
in
your
treason
retorted
MacGregor
and
plunged
his
sword
in
his
prostrate
antagonist
In
the
next
moment
he
was
at
the
carriage
door
handed
out
Miss
Vernon
assisted
her
father
and
me
to
alight
and
dragging
out
the
attorney
head
foremost
threw
him
under
the
wheel
Mr
Osbaldistone
he
said
in
a
whisper
you
have
nothing
to
fear
I
must
look
after
those
who
have
Your
friends
will
soon
be
in
safety
Farewell
and
forget
not
the
MacGregor
He
whistled
his
band
gathered
round
him
and
hurrying
Diana
and
her
father
along
with
him
they
were
almost
instantly
lost
in
the
glades
of
the
forest
The
coachman
and
postilion
had
abandoned
their
horses
and
fled
at
the
first
discharge
of
firearms
but
the
animals
stopped
by
the
barricade
remained
perfectly
still
and
well
for
Jobson
that
they
did
so
for
the
slightest
motion
would
have
dragged
the
wheel
over
his
body
My
first
object
was
to
relieve
him
for
such
was
the
rascal
s
terror
that
he
never
could
have
risen
by
his
own
exertions
I
next
commanded
him
to
observe
that
I
had
neither
taken
part
in
the
rescue
nor
availed
myself
of
it
to
make
my
escape
and
enjoined
him
to
go
down
to
the
Hall
and
call
some
of
his
party
who
had
been
left
there
to
assist
the
wounded
But
Jobson
s
fears
had
so
mastered
and
controlled
every
faculty
of
his
mind
that
he
was
totally
incapable
of
moving
I
now
resolved
to
go
myself
but
in
my
way
I
stumbled
over
the
body
of
a
man
as
I
thought
dead
or
dying
It
was
however
Andrew
Fairservice
as
well
and
whole
as
ever
he
was
in
his
life
who
had
only
taken
this
recumbent
posture
to
avoid
the
slashes
stabs
and
pistol
balls
which
for
a
moment
or
two
were
flying
in
various
directions
I
was
so
glad
to
find
him
that
I
did
not
inquire
how
he
came
thither
but
instantly
commanded
his
assistance
Rashleigh
was
our
first
object
He
groaned
when
I
approached
him
as
much
through
spite
as
through
pain
and
shut
his
eyes
as
if
determined
like
Iago
to
speak
no
word
more
We
lifted
him
into
the
carriage
and
performed
the
same
good
office
to
another
wounded
man
of
his
party
who
had
been
left
on
the
field
I
then
with
difficulty
made
Jobson
understand
that
he
must
enter
the
coach
also
and
support
Sir
Rashleigh
upon
the
seat
He
obeyed
but
with
an
air
as
if
he
but
half
comprehended
my
meaning
Andrew
and
I
turned
the
horses
heads
round
and
opening
the
gate
of
the
avenue
led
them
slowly
back
to
Osbaldistone
Hall
Some
fugitives
had
already
reached
the
Hall
by
circuitous
routes
and
alarmed
its
garrison
by
the
news
that
Sir
Rashleigh
Clerk
Jobson
and
all
their
escort
save
they
who
escaped
to
tell
the
tale
had
been
cut
to
pieces
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
by
a
whole
regiment
of
wild
Highlanders
When
we
reached
the
mansion
therefore
we
heard
such
a
buzz
as
arises
when
bees
are
alarmed
and
mustering
in
their
hives
Mr
Jobson
however
who
had
now
in
some
measure
come
to
his
senses
found
voice
enough
to
make
himself
known
He
was
the
more
anxious
to
be
released
from
the
carriage
as
one
of
his
companions
the
peace
officer
had
to
his
inexpressible
terror
expired
by
his
side
with
a
hideous
groan
Sir
Rashleigh
Osbaldistone
was
still
alive
but
so
dreadfully
wounded
that
the
bottom
of
the
coach
was
filled
with
his
blood
and
long
traces
of
it
left
from
the
entrance
door
into
the
stone
hall
where
he
was
placed
in
a
chair
some
attempting
to
stop
the
bleeding
with
cloths
while
others
called
for
a
surgeon
and
no
one
seemed
willing
to
go
to
fetch
one
Torment
me
not
said
the
wounded
man
I
know
no
assistance
can
avail
me
I
am
a
dying
man
He
raised
himself
in
his
chair
though
the
damps
and
chill
of
death
were
already
on
his
brow
and
spoke
with
a
firmness
which
seemed
beyond
his
strength
Cousin
Francis
he
said
draw
near
to
me
I
approached
him
as
he
requested
I
wish
you
only
to
know
that
the
pangs
of
death
do
not
alter
I
one
iota
of
my
feelings
towards
you
I
hate
you
he
said
the
expression
of
rage
throwing
a
hideous
glare
into
the
eyes
which
were
soon
to
be
closed
for
ever
I
hate
you
with
a
hatred
as
intense
now
while
I
lie
bleeding
and
dying
before
you
as
if
my
foot
trode
on
your
neck
I
have
given
you
no
cause
sir
I
replied
and
for
your
own
sake
I
could
wish
your
mind
in
a
better
temper
You
have
given
me
cause
he
rejoined
In
love
in
ambition
in
the
paths
of
interest
you
have
crossed
and
blighted
me
at
every
turn
I
was
born
to
be
the
honour
of
my
father
s
house
I
have
been
its
disgrace
and
all
owing
to
you
My
very
patrimony
has
become
yours
Take
it
he
said
and
may
the
curse
of
a
dying
man
cleave
to
it
Illustration
The
Death
of
Rashleigh
338
In
a
moment
after
he
had
uttered
this
frightful
wish
he
fell
back
in
the
chair
his
eyes
became
glazed
his
limbs
stiffened
but
the
grin
and
glare
of
mortal
hatred
survived
even
the
last
gasp
of
life
I
will
dwell
no
longer
on
so
painful
a
picture
nor
say
any
more
of
the
death
of
Rashleigh
than
that
it
gave
me
access
to
my
rights
of
inheritance
without
farther
challenge
and
that
Jobson
found
himself
compelled
to
allow
that
the
ridiculous
charge
of
misprision
of
high
treason
was
got
up
on
an
affidavit
which
he
made
with
the
sole
purpose
of
favouring
Rashleigh
s
views
and
removing
me
from
Osbaldistone
Hall
The
rascal
s
name
was
struck
off
the
list
of
attorneys
and
he
was
reduced
to
poverty
and
contempt
I
returned
to
London
when
I
had
put
my
affairs
in
order
at
Osbaldistone
Hall
and
felt
happy
to
escape
from
a
place
which
suggested
so
many
painful
recollections
My
anxiety
was
now
acute
to
learn
the
fate
of
Diana
and
her
father
A
French
gentleman
who
came
to
London
on
commercial
business
was
intrusted
with
a
letter
to
me
from
Miss
Vernon
which
put
my
mind
at
rest
respecting
their
safety
It
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
opportune
appearance
of
MacGregor
and
his
party
was
not
fortuitous
The
Scottish
nobles
and
gentry
engaged
in
the
insurrection
as
well
as
those
of
England
were
particularly
anxious
to
further
the
escape
of
Sir
Frederick
Vernon
who
as
an
old
and
trusted
agent
of
the
house
of
Stuart
was
possessed
of
matter
enough
to
have
ruined
half
Scotland
Rob
Roy
of
whose
sagacity
and
courage
they
had
known
so
many
proofs
was
the
person
whom
they
pitched
upon
to
assist
his
escape
and
the
place
of
meeting
was
fixed
at
Osbaldistone
Hall
You
have
already
heard
how
nearly
the
plan
had
been
disconcerted
by
the
unhappy
Rashleigh
It
succeeded
however
perfectly
for
when
once
Sir
Frederick
and
his
daughter
were
again
at
large
they
found
horses
prepared
for
them
and
by
MacGregor
s
knowledge
of
the
country
for
every
part
of
Scotland
and
of
the
north
of
England
was
familiar
to
him
were
conducted
to
the
western
sea
coast
and
safely
embarked
for
France
The
same
gentleman
told
me
that
Sir
Frederick
was
not
expected
to
survive
for
many
months
a
lingering
disease
the
consequence
of
late
hardships
and
privations
His
daughter
was
placed
in
a
convent
and
although
it
was
her
father
s
wish
she
should
take
the
veil
he
was
understood
to
refer
the
matter
entirely
to
her
own
inclinations
When
these
news
reached
me
I
frankly
told
the
state
of
my
affections
to
my
father
who
was
not
a
little
startled
at
the
idea
of
my
marrying
a
Roman
Catholic
But
he
was
very
desirous
to
see
me
settled
in
life
as
he
called
it
and
he
was
sensible
that
in
joining
him
with
heart
and
hand
in
his
commercial
labours
I
had
sacrificed
my
own
inclinations
After
a
brief
hesitation
and
several
questions
asked
and
answered
to
his
satisfaction
he
broke
out
with
I
little
thought
a
son
of
mine
should
have
been
Lord
of
Osbaldistone
Manor
and
far
less
that
he
should
go
to
a
French
convent
for
a
spouse
But
so
dutiful
a
daughter
cannot
but
prove
a
good
wife
You
have
worked
at
the
desk
to
please
me
Frank
it
is
but
fair
you
should
wive
to
please
yourself
How
I
sped
in
my
wooing
Will
Tresham
I
need
not
tell
you
You
know
too
how
long
and
happily
I
lived
with
Diana
You
know
how
I
lamented
her
but
you
do
not
cannot
know
how
much
she
deserved
her
husband
s
sorrow
I
have
no
more
of
romantic
adventure
to
tell
nor
indeed
anything
to
communicate
farther
since
the
latter
incidents
of
my
life
are
so
well
known
to
one
who
has
shared
with
the
most
friendly
sympathy
the
joys
as
well
as
the
sorrows
by
which
its
scenes
have
been
chequered
I
often
visited
Scotland
but
never
again
saw
the
bold
Highlander
who
had
such
an
influence
on
the
early
events
of
my
life
I
learned
however
from
time
to
time
that
he
continued
to
maintain
his
ground
among
the
mountains
of
Loch
Lomond
in
despite
of
his
powerful
enemies
and
that
he
even
obtained
to
a
certain
degree
the
connivance
of
Government
to
his
self
elected
office
of
protector
of
the
Lennox
in
virtue
of
which
he
levied
black
mail
with
as
much
regularity
as
the
proprietors
did
their
ordinary
rents
It
seemed
impossible
that
his
life
should
have
concluded
without
a
violent
end
Nevertheless
he
died
in
old
age
and
by
a
peaceful
death
some
time
about
the
year
1733
and
is
still
remembered
in
his
country
as
the
Robin
Hood
of
Scotland
the
dread
of
the
wealthy
but
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
possessed
of
many
qualities
both
of
head
and
heart
which
would
have
graced
a
less
equivocal
profession
than
that
to
which
his
fate
condemned
him
Old
Andrew
Fairservice
used
to
say
that
There
were
many
things
ower
bad
for
blessing
and
ower
gude
for
banning
like
Rob
Roy
Here
the
original
manuscript
ends
somewhat
abruptly
I
have
reason
to
think
that
what
followed
related
to
private
a
affairs
POSTSCRIPT
The
second
article
of
the
Appendix
to
the
Introduction
to
Rob
Roy
contains
two
curious
letters
respecting
the
arrest
of
Mr
Grahame
of
Killearn
by
that
daring
freebooter
while
levying
the
Duke
of
Montrose
s
rents
These
were
taken
from
scroll
copies
in
the
possession
of
his
Grace
the
present
Duke
who
kindly
permitted
the
use
of
them
in
the
present
publication
The
Novel
had
but
just
passed
through
the
press
when
the
Right
Honourable
Mr
Peel
whose
important
state
avocations
do
not
avert
his
attention
from
the
interests
of
literature
transmitted
to
the
author
copies
of
the
original
letters
and
enclosure
of
which
he
possessed
only
the
rough
draught
The
originals
were
discovered
in
the
State
Paper
Office
by
the
indefatigable
researches
of
Mr
Lemon
who
is
daily
throwing
more
light
on
that
valuable
collection
of
records
From
the
documents
with
which
the
Author
has
been
thus
kindly
favoured
he
is
enabled
to
fill
up
the
addresses
which
were
wanting
in
the
scrolls
That
of
the
21st
Nov
1716
is
addressed
to
Lord
Viscount
Townshend
and
is
accompanied
by
one
of
the

had
so
many
dispatches
to
make
this
night
I
hope
ye
l
excuse
me
that
I
make
use
of
another

to
give

a
short
account
of
the
occasion
of
this

I

Mr
Graham
younger

Munday
last
in
Menteith
att
a

collecting
my

was
about
nine
o
clock
that
same
night
surprised
by
Rob
Roy
with
a
party
of
his
men
in
arms
who
haveing
surrounded
the
house
and
secured
the
avenues
presented
their
guns
in
at
the
windows
while
he
himself
entered
the
room
with
some
others
with
cokt
pistolls
and
seased
Killearn
with
all
his
money
books
papers
and
bonds
and
carryed
all
away
with
him
to
the
hills
at
the
same
time
ordering
Killearn
to
write
a
letter
to
me
of
which
ye
have
the
copy
inclosed
proposeing
a
very
honourable
treaty
to
me
I
must
say
this
story
was
as
surprising
to
me
as
it
was
insolent
and
it
must
bring
a
very
great
concern
upon
me
that
this
gentleman
my
near
relation
should
be
brought
to
suffer
all
the
barbaritys
and
crueltys
which
revenge
and
mallice
may
suggest
to
these
miscreants
for
his
haveing
acted
a
faithfull
part
in
the
service
of
the
Government
and
his
affection
to
me
in
my
concerns
I
need
not
be
more
particular
to
you

I
know
that
my
Letter
to
my
Lord
Townshend
will
come
into
your

now

remark
that
immediately

he
perceives
from
some
notes
of
information
given
to
Government
that
Rob
Roy
appears
to
have
been
much
employed
and
trusted
by
the
Jacobite
party
even
in
the
very
delicate
task
of
transporting
specie
to
the
Earl
of
Breadalbane
though
it
might
have
somewhat
resembled
trusting

The
Grey
Stone
of
MacGregor
I
have
been
informed
that
at
no
very
remote
period
it
was
proposed
to
take
this
large
stone
which
marks
the
grave
of
Dugald
Ciar
Mhor
and
convert
it
to
the
purpose
of
the
lintel
of
a
window
the
threshold
of
a
door
or
some
such
mean
use
A
man
of
the
clan
MacGregor
who
was
somewhat
deranged
took
fire
at
this
insult
and
when
the
workmen
came
to
remove
the
stone
planted
himself
upon
it
with
a
broad
axe
in
his
hand
swearing
he
would
dash
out
the
brains
of
any
one
who
should
disturb
the
monument
Athletic
in
person
and
insane
enough
to
be
totally
regardless
of
consequences
it
was
thought
best
to
give
way
to
his
humour
and
the
poor
madman
kept
sentinel
on
the
stone
day
and
night
till
the
proposal
of
removing
it
was
entirely
dropped

The
above
is
the
account
which
I
find
in
a
manuscript
history
of
the
clan
MacGregor
of
which
I
was
indulged
with
a
perusal
by
Donald
MacGregor
Esq
late
Major
of
the
33d
regiment
where
great
pains
have
been
taken
to
collect
traditions
and
written
documents
concerning
the
family
But
an
ancient
and
constant
tradition
preserved
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
and
particularly
those
of
the
clan
MacFarlane
relieves
Dugald
Ciar
Mhor
of
the
guilt
of
murdering
the
youths
and
lays
the
blame
on
a
certain
Donald
or
Duncan
Lean
who
performed
the
act
of
cruelty
with
the
assistance
of
a
gillie
who
attended
him
named
Charlioch
or
Charlie
They
say
that
the
homicides
dared
not
again
join
their
clan
but
that
they
resided
in
a
wild
and
solitary
state
as
outlaws
in
an
unfrequented
part
of
the
MacFarlanes
territory
Here
they
lived
for
some
time
undisturbed
till
they
committed
an
act
of
brutal
violence
on
two
defenceless
women
a
mother
and
daughter
of
the
MacFarlane
clan
In
revenge
of
this
atrocity
the
MacFarlanes
hunted
them
down
and
shot
them
It
is
said
that
the
younger
ruffian
Charlioch
might
have
escaped
being
remarkably
swift
of
foot
But
his
crime
became
his
punishment
for
the
female
whom
he
had
outraged
had
defended
herself
desperately
and
had
stabbed
him
with
his
own
dirk
in
the
thigh
He
was
lame
from
the
wound
and
was
the
more
easily
overtaken
and
killed
I
always
inclined
to
think
this
last
the
true
edition
of
the
story
and
that
the
guilt
was
transferred
to
Dugald
Ciar
Mhor
as
a
man
of
higher
name
but
I
have
learned
that
Dugald
was
in
truth
dead
several
years
before
the
battle

authority
being

representative

Gregorson

The
Loch
Lomond
Expedition
The
Loch
Lomond
expedition
was
judged
worthy
to
form
a
separate
pamphlet
which
I
have
not
seen
but
as
quoted
by
the
historian
Rae
it
must
be
delectable
On
the
morrow
being
Thursday
the
13th
they
went
on
their
expedition
and
about
noon
came
to
Inversnaid
the
place
of
danger
where
the
Paisley
men
and
those
of
Dumbarton
and
several
of
the
other
companies
to
the
number
of
an
hundred
men
with
the
greatest
intrepidity
leapt
on
shore
got
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
stood
a
considerable
time
beating
their
drums
all
the
while
but
no
enemy
appearing
they
went
in
quest
of
their
boats
which
the
rebels
had
seized
and
having
casually
lighted
on
some
ropes
and
oars
hid
among
the
shrubs
at
length
they
found
the
boats
drawn
up
a
good
way
on
the
land
which
they
hurled
down
to
the
loch
Such
of
them
as
were
not
damaged
they
carried
off
with
them
and
such
as
were
they
sank
and
hewed
to
pieces
That
same
night
they
returned
to
Luss
and
thence
next
day
to
Dumbarton
from
whence
they
had
at
first
set
out
bringing
along
with
them
the
whole
boats
they
found
in
their
way
on
either
side
of
the
loch
and
in
the
creeks
of
the
isles
and
mooring
them
under
the
cannon
of
the
castle
During
this
expedition
the
pinnaces
discharging
their
patararoes
and
the
men
their
small
arms
made
such
a
thundering
noise
through
the
multiplied
rebounding
echoes
of
the
vast
mountains
on
both
sides
of
the
loch
that
the
MacGregors
were
cowed
and
frighted
away

the
rest

the
rebels

Author
s
Expedition
against
the
MacLarens
The
Author
is
uncertain
whether
it
is
worth
while
to
mention
that
he
had
a
personal
opportunity
of
observing
even
in
his
own
time
that
the
king
s
writ
did
not
pass
quite
current
in
the
Brass
of
Balquhidder
There
were
very
considerable
debts
due
by
Stewart
of
Appin
chiefly
to
the
author
s
family
which
were
likely
to
be
lost
to
the
creditors
if
they
could
not
be
made
available
out
of
this
same
farm
of
Invernenty
the
scene
of
the
murder
done
upon
MacLaren
His
family
consisting
of
several
strapping
deer
stalkers
still
possessed
the
farm
by
virtue
of
a
long
lease
for
a
trifling
rent
There
was
no
chance
of
any
one
buying
it
with
such
an
encumbrance
and
a
transaction
was
entered
into
by
the
MacLarens
who
being
desirous
to
emigrate
to
America
agreed
to
sell
their
lease
to
the
creditors
for
L500
and
to
remove
at
the
next
term
of
Whitsunday
But
whether
they
repented
their
bargain
or
desired
to
make
a
better
or
whether
from
a
mere
point
of
honour
the
MacLarens
declared
they
would
not
permit
a
summons
of
removal
to
be
executed
against
them
which
was
necessary
for
the
legal
completion
of
the
bargain
And
such
was
the
general
impression
that
they
were
men
capable
of
resisting
the
legal
execution
of
warning
by
very
effectual
means
no
king
s
messenger
would
execute
the
summons
without
the
support
of
a
military
force
An
escort
of
a
sergeant
and
six
men
was
obtained
from
a
Highland
regiment
lying
in
Stirling
and
the
Author
then
a
writer
s
apprentice
equivalent
to
the
honourable
situation
of
an
attorney
s
clerk
was
invested
with
the
superintendence
of
the
expedition
with
directions
to
see
that
the
messenger
discharged
his
duty
fully
and
that
the
gallant
sergeant
did
not
exceed
his
part
by
committing
violence
or
plunder
And
thus
it
happened
oddly
enough
that
the
Author
first
entered
the
romantic
scenery
of
Loch
Katrine
of
which
he
may
perhaps
say
he
has
somewhat
extended
the
reputation
riding
in
all
the
dignity
of
danger
with
a
front
and
rear
guard
and
loaded
arms
The
sergeant
was
absolutely
a
Highland
Sergeant
Kite
full
of
stories
of
Rob
Roy
and
of
himself
and
a
very
good
companion
We
experienced
no
interruption
whatever
and
when
we
came
to
Invernenty
found
the
house
deserted
We
took
up
our
quarters
for
the
night
and
used
some
of
the
victuals
which
we
found
there
On
the
morning
we
returned
as
unmolested
as
we
came
The
MacLarens
who
probably
never
thought
of
any
serious
opposition
received
their
money
and
went
to
America
where
having
had
some
slight
share
in
removing
them
from
their
paupera
regna
I
sincerely
hope
they
prospered
The
rent
of
Invernenty
instantly
rose
from
L10
to
L70
or
L80
and
when
sold
the
farm
was
purchased
I
think
by
the
late
Laird
of
MacNab
at
a
price
higher
in
proportion
than
what
even
the
modern
rent
authorised
the
parties
interested
to
hope
for

James
Drummond
MacGregor
and
he
like
Katherine

Allan
Breck
lived
till
the
beginning
of
the
French
Revolution
About
1789
a
friend
of
mine
then
residing
at
Paris
was
invited
to
see
some
procession
which
was
supposed
likely
to
interest
him
from
the
windows
of
an
apartment
occupied
by
a
Scottish
Benedictine
priest
He
found
sitting
by
the
fire
a
tall
thin
raw
boned
grim
looking
old
man
with
the
petit
croix
of
St
Louis
His
visage
was
strongly
marked
by
the
irregular
projections
of
the
cheek
bones
and
chin
His
eyes
were
grey
His
grizzled
hair
exhibited
marks
of
having
been
red
and
his
complexion
was
weather
beaten
and
remarkably
freckled
Some
civilities
in
French
passed
between
the
old
man
and
my
friend
in
the
course
of
which
they
talked
of
the
streets
and
squares
of
Paris

at
length

for
such
he
seemed

he
was

The
Abbess
of
Wilton
The
nunnery
of
Wilton
was
granted
to
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
upon
its
dissolution
by
the
magisterial
authority
of
Henry
VIII
or
his
son
Edward
VI
On
the
accession
of
Queen
Mary
of
Catholic
memory
the
Earl
found
it
necessary
to
reinstate
the
Abbess
and
her
fair
recluses
which
he
did
with
many
expressions
of
his
remorse
kneeling
humbly
to

and
possessions

which
he
had

accession
of

Mons
Meg
Mons
Meg
was
a
large
old
fashioned
piece
of
ordnance
a
great
favourite
with
the
Scottish
common
people
she
was
fabricated
at
Mons
in
Flanders
in
the
reign
of
James
IV
or
V
of
Scotland
This
gun
figures
frequently
in
the
public
accounts
of
the
time
where
we
find
charges
for
grease
to
grease
Meg
s
mouth
withal
to
increase
as
every
schoolboy
knows
the
loudness
of
the
report
ribands
to
deck
her
carriage
and
pipes
to
play
before
her
when
she
was
brought
from
the
Castle
to
accompany
the
Scottish
army
on
any
distant
expedition
After
the
Union
there
was
much
popular
apprehension
that
the
Regalia
of
Scotland
and
the
subordinate
Palladium
Mons
Meg
would
be
carried
to
England
to
complete
the
odious
surrender
of
national
independence
The
Regalia
sequestered
from
the
sight
of
the
public
were
generally
supposed
to
have
been
abstracted
in
this
manner
As
for
Mons
Meg
she
remained
in
the
Castle
of
Edinburgh
till
by
order
of
the
Board
of
Ordnance
she
was
actually
removed
to
Woolwich
about
1757
The
Regalia
by
his
Majesty
s
special
command
have
been
brought
forth
from
their
place
of
concealment
in
1818
and
exposed
to
the
view
of
the
people
by
whom
they
must
be
looked
upon
with
deep
associations
and
in
this
very
winter
of
1828

Mons
Meg
has
been
restored
to
the
country
where
that
which
in
every
other
place
or
situation
was
a
mere
mass
of
rusty
iron
becomes
once
more
a
curious
monument
of
antiquity
Note
H
Fairy
Superstition
The
lakes
and
precipices
amidst
which
the
Avon
Dhu
or
River
Forth
has
its
birth
are
still
according
to
popular
tradition
haunted
by
the
Elfin
people
the
most
peculiar
but
most
pleasing
of
the
creations
of
Celtic
superstitions
The
opinions
entertained
about
these
beings
are
much
the
same
with
those
of
the
Irish
so
exquisitely
well
narrated
by
Mr
Crofton
Croker
An
eminently
beautiful
little
conical
hill
near
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
valley
of
Aberfoil
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
their
peculiar
haunts
and
is
the
scene
which
awakens
in
Andrew
Fairservice
the
terror
of
their
power
It
is
remarkable
that
two
successive
clergymen
of
this
parish
of
Aberfoil
have
employed
themselves
in
writing
about
this
fairy
superstition
The
eldest
of
these
was
Robert
Kirke
a
man
of
some
talents
who
translated
the
Psalms
into
Gaelic
verse
He
had
formerly
been
minister
at
the
neighbouring
parish
of
Balquhidder
and
died
at
Aberfoil
in
1688
at
the
early
age
of
forty
two
He
was
author
of
the
Secret
Commonwealth
which
was
printed
after
his
death
in
1691
an
edition
which
I
have
never
seen
and
was
reprinted
in
Edinburgh
1815
This
is
a
work
concerning
the
fairy
people
in
whose
existence
Mr
Kirke
appears
to
have
been
a
devout
believer
He
describes
them
with
the
usual
powers
and
qualities
ascribed
to
such
beings
in
Highland
tradition
But
what
is
sufficiently
singular
the
Rev
Robert
Kirke
author
of
the
said
treatise
is
believed
himself
to
have
been
taken
away
by
the
fairies
in
revenge
perhaps
for
having
let
in
too
much
light
upon
the
secrets
of
their
commonwealth
We
learn
this
catastrophe
from
the
information
of
his
successor
the
late
amiable
and
learned
Dr
Patrick
Grahame
also
minister
at
Aberfoil
who
in
his
Sketches
of
Perthshire
has
not
forgotten
to
touch
upon
the
Daoine
Schie
or
men
of
peace
The
Rev
Robert
Kirke
was
it
seems
walking
upon
a
little
eminence
to
the
west
of
the
present
manse
which
is
still
held
a
Dun
Shie
or
fairy
mound
when
he
sunk
down
in
what
seemed
to
mortals
a
fit
and
was
supposed
to
be
dead
This
however
was
not
his
real
fate
Mr
Kirke
was
the
near
relation
of
Graham
of
Duchray
the
ancestor
of
the
present
General
Graham
Stirling
Shortly
after
his
funeral
he
appeared
in
the
dress
in
which
he
had
sunk
down
to
a
medical
relation
of
his
own
and
of
Duchray
Go
said
he
to
him
to
my
cousin
Duchray
and
tell
him
that
I
am
not
dead
I
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
was
carried
into
Fairyland
where
I
now
am
Tell
him
that
when
he
and
my
friends
are
assembled
at
the
baptism
of
my
child
for
he
had
left
his
wife
pregnant
I
will
appear
in
the
room
and
that
if
he
throws
the
knife
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
over
my
head
I
will
be
released
and
restored
to
human
society
The
man
it
seems
neglected
for
some
time
to
deliver
the
message
Mr
Kirke
appeared
to
him
a
second
time
threatening
to
haunt
him
night
and
day
till
he
executed
his
commission
which
at
length
he
did
The
time
of
the
baptism
arrived
They
were
seated
at
table
the
figure
of
Mr
Kirke
entered
but
the
Laird
of
Duchray
by
some
unaccountable
fatality
neglected
to
perform
the
prescribed
ceremony
Mr
Kirke
retired
by
another
door
and
was
seen
no
wore
It
is
firmly
believed
that
he
is
at
this
day
in
Fairyland
Sketches
of
Perthshire
p
254
The
treatise
by
Robert
Kirke
here
mentioned
was
written
in
the
year
1691
but
not
printed
till
1815
Note
I
Clachan
of
Aberfoil
I
do
not
know
how
this
might
stand
in
Mr
Osbaldistone
s
day
but
I
can
assure
the
reader
whose
curiosity
may
lead
him
to
visit
the
scenes
of
these
romantic
adventures
that
the
Clachan
of
Aberfoil
now
affords
a
very
comfortable
little
inn
If
he
chances
to
be
a
Scottish
antiquary
it
will
be
an
additional
recommendation
to
him
that
he
will
find
himself
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Rev
Dr
Patrick
Grahame
minister
of
the
gospel
at
Aberfoil
whose
urbanity
in
communicating
information
on
the
subject
of
national
antiquities
is
scarce
exceeded
even
by
the
stores
of
legendary
lore
which
he
has
accumulated
Original
Note
The
respectable
clergyman
alluded
to
has
been
dead
for
some
years
