CHAPTER
XXI
Note
D
Battle
of
Stamford
A
great
topographical
blunder
occurred
here
in
former
editions
The
bloody
battle
alluded
to
in
the
text
fought
and
won
by
King
Harold
over
his
brother
the
rebellious
Tosti
and
an
auxiliary
force
of
Danes
or
Norsemen
was
said
in
the
text
and
a
corresponding
note
to
have
taken
place
at
Stamford
in
Leicestershire
and
upon
the
river
Welland
This
is
a
mistake
into
which
the
author
has
been
led
by
trusting
to
his
memory
and
so
confounding
two
places
of
the
same
name
The
Stamford
Strangford
or
Staneford
at
which
the
battle
really
was
fought
is
a
ford
upon
the
river
Derwent
at
the
distance
of
about
seven
miles
from
York
and
situated
in
that
large
and
opulent
county
A
long
wooden
bridge
over
the
Derwent
the
site
of
which
with
one
remaining
buttress
is
still
shown
to
the
curious
traveller
was
furiously
contested
One
Norwegian
long
defended
it
by
his
single
arm
and
was
at
length
pierced
with
a
spear
thrust
through
the
planks
of
the
bridge
from
a
boat
beneath
The
neighbourhood
of
Stamford
on
the
Derwent
contains
some
memorials
of
the
battle
Horseshoes
swords
and
the
heads
of
halberds
or
bills
are
often
found
there
one
place
is
called
the
Danes
well
another
the
Battle
flats
From
a
tradition
that
the
weapon
with
which
the
Norwegian
champion
was
slain
resembled
a
pear
or
as
others
say
that
the
trough
or
boat
in
which
the
soldier
floated
under
the
bridge
to
strike
the
blow
had
such
a
shape
the
country
people
usually
begin
a
great
market
which
is
held
at
Stamford
with
an
entertainment
called
the
Pear
pie
feast
which
after
all
may
be
a
corruption
of
the
Spear
pie
feast
For
more
particulars
Drake
s
History
of
York
may
be
referred
to
The
author
s
mistake
was
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
most
obliging
manner
by
Robert
Belt
Esq
of
Bossal
House
The
battle
was
fought
in
1066
