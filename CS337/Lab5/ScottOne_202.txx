CHAPTER
XXII
Note
E
The
range
of
iron
bars
above
that
glowing
charcoal
This
horrid
species
of
torture
may
remind
the
reader
of
that
to
which
the
Spaniards
subjected
Guatimozin
in
order
to
extort
a
discovery
of
his
concealed
wealth
But
in
fact
an
instance
of
similar
barbarity
is
to
be
found
nearer
home
and
occurs
in
the
annals
of
Queen
Mary
s
time
containing
so
many
other
examples
of
atrocity
Every
reader
must
recollect
that
after
the
fall
of
the
Catholic
Church
and
the
Presbyterian
Church
Government
had
been
established
by
law
the
rank
and
especially
the
wealth
of
the
Bishops
Abbots
Priors
and
so
forth
were
no
longer
vested
in
ecclesiastics
but
in
lay
impropriators
of
the
church
revenues
or
as
the
Scottish
lawyers
called
them
titulars
of
the
temporalities
of
the
benefice
though
having
no
claim
to
the
spiritual
character
of
their
predecessors
in
office
Of
these
laymen
who
were
thus
invested
with
ecclesiastical
revenues
some
were
men
of
high
birth
and
rank
like
the
famous
Lord
James
Stewart
the
Prior
of
St
Andrews
who
did
not
fail
to
keep
for
their
own
use
the
rents
lands
and
revenues
of
the
church
But
if
on
the
other
hand
the
titulars
were
men
of
inferior
importance
who
had
been
inducted
into
the
office
by
the
interest
of
some
powerful
person
it
was
generally
understood
that
the
new
Abbot
should
grant
for
his
patron
s
benefit
such
leases
and
conveyances
of
the
church
lands
and
tithes
as
might
afford
their
protector
the
lion
s
share
of
the
booty
This
was
the
origin
of
those
who
were
wittily
termed
Tulchan
61
Bishops
being
a
sort
of
imaginary
prelate
whose
image
was
set
up
to
enable
his
patron
and
principal
to
plunder
the
benefice
under
his
name
There
were
other
cases
however
in
which
men
who
had
got
grants
of
these
secularised
benefices
were
desirous
of
retaining
them
for
their
own
use
without
having
the
influence
sufficient
to
establish
their
purpose
and
these
became
frequently
unable
to
protect
themselves
however
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
exactions
of
the
feudal
tyrant
of
the
district
Bannatyne
secretary
to
John
Knox
recounts
a
singular
course
of
oppression
practised
on
one
of
those
titulars
abbots
by
the
Earl
of
Cassilis
in
Ayrshire
whose
extent
of
feudal
influence
was
so
wide
that
he
was
usually
termed
the
King
of
Carrick
We
give
the
fact
as
it
occurs
in
Bannatyne
s
Journal
only
premising
that
the
Journalist
held
his
master
s
opinions
both
with
respect
to
the
Earl
of
Cassilis
as
an
opposer
of
the
king
s
party
and
as
being
a
detester
of
the
practice
of
granting
church
revenues
to
titulars
instead
of
their
being
devoted
to
pious
uses
such
as
the
support
of
the
clergy
expense
of
schools
and
the
relief
of
the
national
poor
He
mingles
in
the
narrative
therefore
a
well
deserved
feeling
of
execration
against
the
tyrant
who
employed
the
torture
which
a
tone
of
ridicule
towards
the
patient
as
if
after
all
it
had
not
been
ill
bestowed
on
such
an
equivocal
and
amphibious
character
as
a
titular
abbot
He
entitles
his
narrative
THE
EARL
OF
CASSILIS
TYRANNY
AGAINST
A
QUICK
i
e
LIVING
MAN
Master
Allan
Stewart
friend
to
Captain
James
Stewart
of
Cardonall
by
means
of
the
Queen
s
corrupted
court
obtained
the
Abbey
of
Crossraguel
The
said
Earl
thinking
himself
greater
than
any
king
in
those
quarters
determined
to
have
that
whole
benefice
as
he
hath
divers
others
to
pay
at
his
pleasure
and
because
he
could
not
find
sic
security
as
his
insatiable
appetite
required
this
shift
was
devised
The
said
Mr
Allan
being
in
company
with
the
Laird
of
Bargany
also
a
Kennedy
was
by
the
Earl
and
his
friends
enticed
to
leave
the
safeguard
which
he
had
with
the
Laird
and
come
to
make
good
cheer
with
the
said
Earl
The
simplicity
of
the
imprudent
man
was
suddenly
abused
and
so
he
passed
his
time
with
them
certain
days
which
he
did
in
Maybole
with
Thomas
Kennedie
uncle
to
the
said
Earl
after
which
the
said
Mr
Allan
passed
with
quiet
company
to
visit
the
place
and
bounds
of
Crossraguel
his
abbacy
of
which
the
said
Earl
being
surely
advertised
determined
to
put
in
practice
the
tyranny
which
long
before
he
had
conceived
And
so
as
king
of
the
country
apprehended
the
said
Mr
Allan
and
carried
him
to
the
house
of
Denure
where
for
a
season
he
was
honourably
treated
if
a
prisoner
can
think
any
entertainment
pleasing
but
after
that
certain
days
were
spent
and
that
the
Earl
could
not
obtain
the
feus
of
Crossraguel
according
to
his
own
appetite
he
determined
to
prove
if
a
collation
could
work
that
which
neither
dinner
nor
supper
could
do
for
a
long
time
And
so
the
said
Mr
Allan
was
carried
to
a
secret
chamber
with
him
passed
the
honourable
Earl
his
worshipful
brother
and
such
as
were
appointed
to
be
servants
at
that
banquet
In
the
chamber
there
was
a
grit
iron
chimlay
under
it
a
fire
other
grit
provision
was
not
seen
The
first
course
was
My
Lord
Abbot
said
the
Earl
it
will
please
you
confess
here
that
with
your
own
consent
you
remain
in
my
company
because
ye
durst
not
commit
yourself
to
the
hands
of
others
The
Abbot
answered
Would
you
my
lord
that
I
should
make
a
manifest
lie
for
your
pleasure
The
truth
is
my
lord
it
is
against
my
will
that
I
am
here
neither
yet
have
I
any
pleasure
in
your
company
But
ye
shall
remain
with
me
nevertheless
at
this
time
said
the
Earl
I
am
not
able
to
resist
your
will
and
pleasure
said
the
Abbot
in
this
place
Ye
must
then
obey
me
said
the
Earl
and
with
that
were
presented
unto
him
certain
letters
to
subscribe
amongst
which
there
was
a
five
years
tack
and
a
nineteen
years
tack
and
a
charter
of
feu
of
all
the
lands
of
Crossraguel
with
all
the
clauses
necessary
for
the
Earl
to
haste
him
to
hell
For
if
adultery
sacrilege
oppression
barbarous
cruelty
and
theft
heaped
upon
theft
deserve
hell
the
great
King
of
Carrick
can
no
more
escape
hell
for
ever
than
the
imprudent
Abbot
escaped
the
fire
for
a
season
as
follows
After
that
the
Earl
spied
repugnance
and
saw
that
he
could
not
come
to
his
purpose
by
fair
means
he
commanded
his
cooks
to
prepare
the
banquet
and
so
first
they
flayed
the
sheep
that
is
they
took
off
the
Abbot
s
cloathes
even
to
his
skin
and
next
they
bound
him
to
the
chimney
his
legs
to
the
one
end
and
his
arms
to
the
other
and
so
they
began
to
beet
i
e
feed
the
fire
sometimes
to
his
buttocks
sometimes
to
his
legs
sometimes
to
his
shoulders
and
arms
and
that
the
roast
might
not
burn
but
that
it
might
rest
in
soppe
they
spared
not
flambing
with
oil
basting
as
a
cook
bastes
roasted
meat
Lord
look
thou
to
sic
cruelty
And
that
the
crying
of
the
miserable
man
should
not
be
heard
they
dosed
his
mouth
that
the
voice
might
be
stopped
It
may
be
suspected
that
some
partisan
of
the
King
s
Darnley
s
murder
was
there
In
that
torment
they
held
the
poor
man
till
that
often
he
cried
for
God
s
sake
to
dispatch
him
for
he
had
as
meikle
gold
in
his
awin
purse
as
would
buy
powder
enough
to
shorten
his
pain
The
famous
King
of
Carrick
and
his
cooks
perceiving
the
roast
to
be
aneuch
commanded
it
to
be
tane
fra
the
fire
and
the
Earl
himself
began
the
grace
in
this
manner
Benedicite
Jesus
Maria
you
are
the
most
obstinate
man
that
ever
I
saw
gif
I
had
known
that
ye
had
been
so
stubborn
I
would
not
for
a
thousand
crowns
have
handled
you
so
I
never
did
so
to
man
before
you
And
yet
he
returned
to
the
same
practice
within
two
days
and
ceased
not
till
that
he
obtained
his
formost
purpose
that
is
that
he
had
got
all
his
pieces
subscryvit
alsweill
as
ane
half
roasted
hand
could
do
it
The
Earl
thinking
himself
sure
enough
so
long
as
he
had
the
half
roasted
Abbot
in
his
own
keeping
and
yet
being
ashamed
of
his
presence
by
reason
of
his
former
cruelty
left
the
place
of
Denure
in
the
hands
of
certain
of
his
servants
and
the
half
roasted
Abbot
to
be
kept
there
as
prisoner
The
Laird
of
Bargany
out
of
whose
company
the
said
Abbot
had
been
enticed
understanding
not
the
extremity
but
the
retaining
of
the
man
sent
to
the
court
and
raised
letters
of
deliverance
of
the
person
of
the
man
according
to
the
order
which
being
disobeyed
the
said
Earl
for
his
contempt
was
denounced
rebel
and
put
to
the
horne
But
yet
hope
was
there
none
neither
to
the
afflicted
to
be
delivered
neither
yet
to
the
purchaser
i
e
procurer
of
the
letters
to
obtain
any
comfort
thereby
for
in
that
time
God
was
despised
and
the
lawful
authority
was
contemned
in
Scotland
in
hope
of
the
sudden
return
and
regiment
of
that
cruel
murderer
of
her
awin
husband
of
whose
lords
the
said
Earl
was
called
one
and
yet
oftener
than
once
he
was
solemnly
sworn
to
the
King
and
to
his
Regent
The
Journalist
then
recites
the
complaint
of
the
injured
Allan
Stewart
Commendator
of
Crossraguel
to
the
Regent
and
Privy
Council
averring
his
having
been
carried
partly
by
flattery
partly
by
force
to
the
black
vault
of
Denure
a
strong
fortalice
built
on
a
rock
overhanging
the
Irish
channel
where
to
execute
leases
and
conveyances
of
the
whole
churches
and
parsonages
belonging
to
the
Abbey
of
Crossraguel
which
he
utterly
refused
as
an
unreasonable
demand
and
the
more
so
that
he
had
already
conveyed
them
to
John
Stewart
of
Cardonah
by
whose
interest
he
had
been
made
Commendator
The
complainant
proceeds
to
state
that
he
was
after
many
menaces
stript
bound
and
his
limbs
exposed
to
fire
in
the
manner
already
described
till
compelled
by
excess
of
agony
he
subscribed
the
charter
and
leases
presented
to
him
of
the
contents
of
which
he
was
totally
ignorant
A
few
days
afterwards
being
again
required
to
execute
a
ratification
of
these
deeds
before
a
notary
and
witnesses
and
refusing
to
do
so
he
was
once
more
subjected
to
the
same
torture
until
his
agony
was
so
excessive
that
he
exclaimed
Fye
on
you
why
do
you
not
strike
your
whingers
into
me
or
blow
me
up
with
a
barrel
of
powder
rather
than
torture
me
thus
unmercifully
upon
which
the
Earl
commanded
Alexander
Richard
one
of
his
attendants
to
stop
the
patient
s
mouth
with
a
napkin
which
was
done
accordingly
Thus
he
was
once
more
compelled
to
submit
to
their
tyranny
The
petition
concluded
with
stating
that
the
Earl
under
pretence
of
the
deeds
thus
iniquitously
obtained
had
taken
possession
of
the
whole
place
and
living
of
Crossraguel
and
enjoyed
the
profits
thereof
for
three
years
The
doom
of
the
Regent
and
Council
shows
singularly
the
total
interruption
of
justice
at
this
calamitous
period
even
in
the
most
clamant
cases
of
oppression
The
Council
declined
interference
with
the
course
of
the
ordinary
justice
of
the
county
which
was
completely
under
the
said
Earl
of
Cassilis
control
and
only
enacted
that
he
should
forbear
molestation
of
the
unfortunate
Comendator
under
the
surety
of
two
thousand
pounds
Scots
The
Earl
was
appointed
also
to
keep
the
peace
towards
the
celebrated
George
Buchanan
who
had
a
pension
out
of
the
same
Abbacy
to
a
similar
extent
and
under
the
like
penalty
The
consequences
are
thus
described
by
the
Journalist
already
quoted
The
said
Laird
of
Bargany
perceiving
that
the
ordiner
justice
could
neither
help
the
oppressed
nor
yet
the
afflicted
applied
his
mind
to
the
next
remedy
and
in
the
end
by
his
servants
took
the
house
of
Denure
where
the
poor
Abbot
was
kept
prisoner
The
bruit
flew
fra
Carrick
to
Galloway
and
so
suddenly
assembled
herd
and
hyre
man
that
pertained
to
the
band
of
the
Kennedies
and
so
within
a
few
hours
was
the
house
of
Denure
environed
again
The
master
of
Cassilis
was
the
frackast
i
e
the
readiest
or
boldest
and
would
not
stay
but
in
his
heat
would
lay
fire
to
the
dungeon
with
no
small
boasting
that
all
enemies
within
the
house
should
die
He
was
required
and
admonished
by
those
that
were
within
to
be
more
moderate
and
not
to
hazard
himself
so
foolishly
But
no
admonition
would
help
till
that
the
wind
of
an
hacquebute
blasted
his
shoulder
and
then
ceased
he
from
further
pursuit
in
fury
The
Laird
of
Bargany
had
before
purchest
obtained
of
the
authorities
letters
charging
all
faithfull
subjects
to
the
King
s
Majesty
to
assist
him
against
that
cruel
tyrant
and
mansworn
traitor
the
Earl
of
Cassilis
which
letters
with
his
private
writings
he
published
and
shortly
found
sic
concurrence
of
Kyle
and
Cunynghame
with
his
other
friends
that
the
Carrick
company
drew
back
fra
the
house
and
so
the
other
approached
furnished
the
house
with
more
men
delivered
the
said
Mr
Allan
and
carried
him
to
Ayr
where
publicly
at
the
market
cross
of
the
said
town
he
declared
how
cruelly
he
was
entreated
and
how
the
murdered
King
suffered
not
sic
torment
as
he
did
excepting
only
he
escaped
the
death
and
therefore
publickly
did
revoke
all
things
that
were
done
in
that
extremity
and
especially
revoked
the
subscription
of
the
three
writings
to
wit
of
a
fyve
yeir
tack
and
nineteen
year
tack
and
of
a
charter
of
feu
And
so
the
house
remained
and
remains
till
this
day
the
7th
of
February
1571
in
the
custody
of
the
said
Laird
of
Bargany
and
of
his
servants
And
so
cruelty
was
disappointed
of
proffeit
present
and
shall
be
eternallie
punished
unless
he
earnestly
repent
And
this
far
for
the
cruelty
committed
to
give
occasion
unto
others
and
to
such
as
hate
the
monstrous
dealing
of
degenerate
nobility
to
look
more
diligently
upon
their
behaviuours
and
to
paint
them
forth
unto
the
world
that
they
themselves
may
be
ashamed
of
their
own
beastliness
and
that
the
world
may
be
advertised
and
admonished
to
abhor
detest
and
avoid
the
company
of
all
sic
tyrants
who
are
not
worthy
of
the
society
of
men
but
ought
to
be
sent
suddenly
to
the
devil
with
whom
they
must
burn
without
end
for
their
contempt
of
God
and
cruelty
committed
against
his
creatures
Let
Cassilis
and
his
brother
be
the
first
to
be
the
example
unto
others
Amen
Amen

This
extract
has
been
somewhat
amended
or
modernized
in
orthography
to
render
it
more
intelligible
to
the
general
reader
I
have
to
add
that
the
Kennedies
of
Bargany
who
interfered
in
behalf
of
the
oppressed
Abbot
were
themselves
a
younger
branch
of
the
Cassilis
family
but
held
different
politics
and
were
powerful
enough
in
this
and
other
instances
to
bid
them
defiance
The
ultimate
issue
of
this
affair
does
not
appear
but
as
the
house
of
Cassilis
are
still
in
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
the
feus
and
leases
which
belonged
to
Crossraguel
Abbey
it
is
probable
the
talons
of
the
King
of
Carrick
were
strong
enough
in
those
disorderly
times
to
retain
the
prey
which
they
had
so
mercilessly
fixed
upon
I
may
also
add
that
it
appears
by
some
papers
in
my
possession
that
the
officers
or
Country
Keepers
on
the
border
were
accustomed
to
torment
their
prisoners
by
binding
them
to
the
iron
bars
of
their
chimneys
to
extort
confession
