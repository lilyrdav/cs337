CHAPTER
XVII
Note
C
Minstrelsy
The
realm
of
France
it
is
well
known
was
divided
betwixt
the
Norman
and
Teutonic
race
who
spoke
the
language
in
which
the
word
Yes
is
pronounced
as
oui
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
regions
whose
speech
bearing
some
affinity
to
the
Italian
pronounced
the
same
word
oc
The
poets
of
the
former
race
were
called
Minstrels
and
their
poems
Lays
those
of
the
latter
were
termed
Troubadours
and
their
compositions
called
sirventes
and
other
names
Richard
a
professed
admirer
of
the
joyous
science
in
all
its
branches
could
imitate
either
the
minstrel
or
troubadour
It
is
less
likely
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
compose
or
sing
an
English
ballad
yet
so
much
do
we
wish
to
assimilate
Him
of
the
Lion
Heart
to
the
band
of
warriors
whom
he
led
that
the
anachronism
if
there
be
one
may
readily
be
forgiven
