CHAPTER

A
NOTE
ON
THE
TEXT
ADVERTISEMENT
BY
THE
AUTHORESS
TO
NORTHANGER
ABBEY
This
little
work
was
finished
in
the
year
1803
and
intended
for
immediate
publication
It
was
disposed
of
to
a
bookseller
it
was
even
advertised
and
why
the
business
proceeded
no
farther
the
author
has
never
been
able
to
learn
That
any
bookseller
should
think
it
worthwhile
to
purchase
what
he
did
not
think
it
worthwhile
to
publish
seems
extraordinary
But
with
this
neither
the
author
nor
the
public
have
any
other
concern
than
as
some
observation
is
necessary
upon
those
parts
of
the
work
which
thirteen
years
have
made
comparatively
obsolete
The
public
are
entreated
to
bear
in
mind
that
thirteen
years
have
passed
since
it
was
finished
many
more
since
it
was
begun
and
that
during
that
period
places
manners
books
and
opinions
have
undergone
considerable
changes
